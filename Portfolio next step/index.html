                    <h2>CAPTAIN PRICE</h2>
                    <p>With his service in the 22nd SAS Regiment, John Price has spent most of his career fighting in the shadows. He's been shot, captured, abandoned, blown up, locked up, tortured, and left for dead. 
                        Price is a veteran of military operations in nearly every conflict-prone corner of the world, distinguishing himself with acts of gallantry and intrepidity. 
                        His achievements have risen to the stuff of regimental history.
                        Price joined the infantry at the age of sixteen and has served in the British Army for eighteen years. 
                        One of the youngest cadets to ever graduate the Royal Military Academy as a commissioned officer, he completed Special Service Commando selection and was 'badged' a member of the SAS, proving his worth on countless covert operations over multiple deployments in the Middle East. 
                        Promoted to captain in 2011, call-sign 'Bravo Six', Price is the officer in charge of a highly effective unit, tasked with anti–hijacking counter–terrorism, specializing in close quarter combat, sniper techniques and hostage rescue.
                        He is unofficially missioned to capture or kill high value targets.
                        Blessed with uncanny instincts and an unchecked determination, Captain Price is a peerless combat-tracker, 
                        known for excelling in a fluid and volatile environment. An elite seek-and-strike expert, Price is versed in a wide range of field craft and tactical capability.
                        From airborne shock-trooper to long-range reconnaissance operator, Captain Price is a covert, jungle, desert and urban operator, sniper and saboteur.
                        With a knack for developing and maintaining links to foreign fighters across the globe by earning goodwill through trust, Captain Price works closely with Western intelligence agencies assigned to aggressively pursue HVTs.
                        His counter-terrorism squadron is on call to mobilize anywhere in Europe with immediate readiness.
                        Price believes that the duty of every soldier is to fight for the greater good— "The rules of engagement don't change, but their justification does.
                        " Price always fights for what's right but he knows what's right isn't always what you're fighting for. He's often said, "One man's terrorist is another man's freedom fighter.
                        " Sometimes unpredictable and unrestrained, John Price has a golden rule all his own: "We get dirty, and the world stays clean."
                        Although an officer, Captain Price has always preferred to keep the company of an enlisted warfighter. 
                        John often tells new recruits: "All it takes to change the course of history... is the will of a single man or woman." Not above a rogue move or an unholy alliance in the name of getting the job done,
                        John has a deep but often strained relationship with the system.[2]
                        Much like Sergeant Kyle, Price seems to hate being tied down by rules or procedures, and sometimes takes drastic actions on his own, often against orders.</p>
